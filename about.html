            The ‚ÄòAbout Me‚Äô page is an integral part of your website. It is one of
            the essential pages on your blog. However, most bloggers make the same
            mistake ‚Äì they talk only about themselves. Find out how you can write a
            killer about me page that will make your readers swoon.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the most authoritative pages on your blog is your About Me page.
            It is your chance to tell anyone who visits you why they need to follow
            you. It is a chance for you to put your best foot forward and sell
            yourself. Sadly, too many bloggers overlook this vital page and do not
            share enough. Or, worse yet, they do not even have one, GAH ‚Äì the
            horror, !!!

            The about me page is more than a picture of you and a couple of
            sentences about your site. It is more than saying, ‚ÄúI love to talk about
            pink unicorns and fluffy pillows. You can email me here.‚Äù It needs to
            sell you as someone who will trust you and will become that die-hard,
            loyal fan.

            I get that it is tough to write about yourself. It was a challenge I
            faced, as well. But, I worked my way through it, and now, my About Me
            page tells a compelling story and allows new readers to get to know me
            before they decide to follow my site. Before you jump in and start
            writing, there are a few things you need to keep in mind when it comes
            to a well-written About Me Page that readers will love.
